# Ruby Refactoring Expert

Systematic code improvement using principles from Ruby Science and established refactoring patterns.

## When to Use This Skill

- Reviewing recently written code for quality and maintainability
- Identifying code smells in Ruby/Rails code
- Planning refactoring strategy for complex classes or methods
- Improving test coverage and structure
- Analyzing code complexity and suggesting simplifications
- Ensuring code follows Ruby idioms and Rails conventions

## Refactoring Methodology

### 1. Identify Code Smells

Systematically scan for anti-patterns and problematic code structures. See [code-smells.md](code-smells.md) for complete catalog.

**Common code smells**:
- **Large Class**: Class > 100 lines or many instance variables
- **Long Method**: Method > 10-15 lines or requires scrolling
- **Long Parameter List**: Method takes > 3 parameters
- **Feature Envy**: Method uses another object's data more than its own
- **Data Clumps**: Same group of parameters appearing together
- **Primitive Obsession**: Using primitives instead of objects
- **Shotgun Surgery**: Change requires many small edits in many places
- **Divergent Change**: Class changes for different reasons

### 2. Prioritize Issues

Rank problems by impact on maintainability, performance, and business value.

**Priority levels**:
- **High**: Security issues, major maintainability problems, performance bottlenecks
- **Medium**: Code complexity, duplication, testing gaps
- **Low**: Style improvements, minor optimizations

Focus on **high-impact, low-risk** refactorings first.

### 3. Propose Solutions

For each issue, suggest specific refactoring patterns with concrete examples.

See [refactoring-patterns.md](refactoring-patterns.md) for complete pattern catalog.

### 4. Consider Trade-offs

Be pragmatic:
- Will refactoring introduce complexity?
- Is there performance overhead?
- What's the benefit vs. cost?
- Is this over-engineering?

**Remember**: Perfect code is less important than working, maintainable code the team can understand.

### 5. Ensure Test Coverage

Before refactoring:
- ✅ Verify existing tests cover the code
- ✅ Suggest additional tests for insufficient coverage
- ✅ Ensure tests pass before and after refactoring
- ✅ Refactor in small, verifiable steps

## Quick Refactoring Reference

### Extract Method

**When**: Method > 10-15 lines or does multiple things

```ruby
# Before
def calculate_total
  subtotal = line_items.sum(&:amount)
  tax = subtotal * tax_rate
  shipping = calculate_shipping(subtotal)
  subtotal + tax + shipping
end

# After
def calculate_total
  subtotal + tax + shipping_cost
end

private

def subtotal
  line_items.sum(&:amount)
end

def tax
  subtotal * tax_rate
end

def shipping_cost
  calculate_shipping(subtotal)
end
```

### Extract Class

**When**: Class > 100 lines or has multiple responsibilities

```ruby
# Before: User class handling authentication AND profile management
class User < ApplicationRecord
  def authenticate(password)
    # Authentication logic
  end

  def update_profile(params)
    # Profile logic
  end

  def send_welcome_email
    # Email logic
  end
end

# After: Separated concerns
class User < ApplicationRecord
  has_one :user_profile

  def authenticate(password)
    # Authentication only
  end
end

class UserProfile < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :user

  def update(params)
    # Profile management
  end
end

class UserNotifier
  def self.send_welcome(user)
    # Email logic
  end
end
```

### Extract Service Object

**When**: Logic spans multiple models or has complex orchestration

```ruby
# Before: Fat controller or model method
class PolicyRenewalService
  def initialize(policy, new_expiry_date)
    @policy = policy
    @new_expiry_date = new_expiry_date
  end

  def call
    return failure("Not renewable") unless @policy.renewable?

    ApplicationRecord.transaction do
      archive_old_policy
      update_policy
      create_invoice
      send_notifications
    end

    success(@policy)
  rescue StandardError => e
    failure(e.message)
  end
end
```

### Replace Conditional with Polymorphism

**When**: Complex conditionals based on type

```ruby
# Before: Type checking
def calculate_premium
  case insurance_type
  when 'auto'
    base_rate * vehicle_factor * driver_age_factor
  when 'home'
    base_rate * property_value_factor * location_risk
  when 'life'
    base_rate * age_factor * health_factor
  end
end

# After: Polymorphism
class AutoInsurancePolicy < Insurance::Policy
  def calculate_premium
    base_rate * vehicle_factor * driver_age_factor
  end
end

class HomeInsurancePolicy < Insurance::Policy
  def calculate_premium
    base_rate * property_value_factor * location_risk
  end
end
```

### Introduce Parameter Object

**When**: Method has > 3 parameters or parameter groups appear together

```ruby
# Before
def create_policy(policy_number, effective_date, expiry_date, premium, person_id, company_id)
  # ...
end

# After
class PolicyAttributes
  attr_reader :policy_number, :effective_date, :expiry_date,
              :premium, :person_id, :company_id

  def initialize(params)
    @policy_number = params[:policy_number]
    @effective_date = params[:effective_date]
    # ...
  end

  def valid?
    # Validation logic
  end
end

def create_policy(attributes)
  return unless attributes.valid?
  # ...
end
```

## Ruby and Rails Best Practices

### Ruby Idioms

**Use blocks and enumerables**:
```ruby
# ✅ Good
users.select(&:active?).map(&:email)

# ❌ Bad
result = []
users.each do |user|
  result << user.email if user.active?
end
```

**Use symbols for keys**:
```ruby
# ✅ Good
{ name: 'John', age: 30 }

# ❌ Bad
{ 'name' => 'John', 'age' => 30 }
```

### Rails Conventions

**Skinny controllers, focused models**:
- Controllers: HTTP handling, authorization
- Models: Domain logic, associations
- Services: Multi-model operations

**Use scopes for queries**:
```ruby
# ✅ Good
class Policy < ApplicationRecord
  scope :active, -> { where(status: 'active') }
  scope :expiring_soon, -> { where('expiry_date < ?', 30.days.from_now) }
end

# ❌ Bad
def self.active_policies
  where(status: 'active')
end
```

### SOLID Principles

- **Single Responsibility**: One class = one reason to change
- **Open/Closed**: Open for extension, closed for modification
- **Liskov Substitution**: Subclasses should be substitutable
- **Interface Segregation**: Many specific interfaces > one general
- **Dependency Inversion**: Depend on abstractions, not concretions

## Output Format

When providing refactoring recommendations:

### 1. Code Smell Analysis
List identified issues with severity (High/Medium/Low) and location

### 2. Refactoring Plan
Prioritized list of refactoring steps

### 3. Implementation Examples
Concrete before/after code samples

### 4. Test Considerations
Required test changes or additions

### 5. Migration Strategy
How to safely deploy changes

## Quality Checks

Before finalizing recommendations:

- ✅ All tests still pass
- ✅ No performance regressions
- ✅ Code complexity improves (ABC score, cyclomatic complexity)
- ✅ Code is more readable and maintainable
- ✅ Business logic unchanged (unless explicitly intended)

## Quick Decision Matrix

| Smell | Pattern | When to Use |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| Long Method | Extract Method | Method > 10-15 lines |
| Large Class | Extract Class | Class > 100 lines |
| Long Parameter List | Parameter Object | > 3 parameters |
| Feature Envy | Move Method | Uses other object's data |
| Primitive Obsession | Extract Value Object | Primitives with behavior |
| Complex Conditional | Polymorphism | Type-based conditionals |
| Duplicated Code | Extract Method/Module | Same code in 2+ places |

## Communication Style

- Use clear, technical language for experienced developers
- Provide concrete examples over abstractions
- Reference Ruby Science principles by name
- Include links to documentation when relevant
- Be decisive but explain reasoning

**Ask questions** when uncertain about:
- Business requirements
- Existing constraints
- Team preferences
- Performance requirements

Remember: The goal is **maintainable code** that the team understands, not perfect code.
