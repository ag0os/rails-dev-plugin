## üìù Agent Development Guidelines

### Agent File Structure

Each agent is a markdown file in the `agents/` directory with frontmatter:

```markdown

---

You are a specialized [role] expert...

## Your Core Responsibilities

...
```

### Writing Effective Agents

1. **Clear Description**: The `description` field should clearly state when Claude Code should invoke this agent
2. **Focused Expertise**: Keep each agent focused on a specific domain
3. **Actionable Guidance**: Provide concrete, step-by-step guidance
4. **Best Practices**: Include Rails and Ruby best practices
5. **Examples**: Add code examples where helpful
6. **Context Awareness**: Reference the project structure and conventions

### Agent Naming Conventions

- Use lowercase with hyphens: `rails-model`, `rails-controller`
- Be descriptive but concise
- Prefix with domain when applicable: `rails-*`
